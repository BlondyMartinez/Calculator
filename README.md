# Calculator Project 🧮

Welcome to my calculator project! This simple yet powerful calculator is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It's responsive, supports both chain operations and operations that follow the order of operations (PEMDAS), and even allows input via keyboard.

## Features ✨
- **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly across various screen sizes.
- **Chain Operations**: Allows chaining multiple operations together.
- **Order of Operations**: Follows PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division, Addition and Subtraction) for accurate calculations.
- **Keyboard Support**: Input calculations using your keyboard for increased efficiency.
